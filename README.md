## Scales of Data
Introduced in the 1940's by [Stanley Smith Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Smith_Stevens)

Ordinal: data *with instrinsic order; usually numerical

Nominal: data *without* intrinsic order

Logarithmic
*It is stunning to realize how many people are looking at the data visuazliation of Covid that are logarithmic and yet have no idea what that means!*


## Tools
[Python](https://www.python.org/)
[R](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/)
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
[P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
[MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

There are also software packages, like [Tableau](x), that are frequently used.

There are also good tools inside standard software, like Microsoft Excel.

In short, its less about the tool.

## Different Kinds of data

First, remember that there is "nothing natural about data." â€” Be skeptical.

But assuming you start a data visualization with data, look at the data. What do you have? What do you not have? Is there other data that might be interesting to combine? What story are you trying to tell about this data (in a completely ethical and objective way of course)?

Start sketching!

###Types of data:
Anything digital can be treated as data!



Tables

[CSV: Comma Separated Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

[JSON: JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

Note: JSON is great, but the trick is getting used to "traversing," or getting the right syntax to get the data you want.

Not really a "type of data" but you will often get data through an [API: Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). Most API's deliver JSON formatted data.
