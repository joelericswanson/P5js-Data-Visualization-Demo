### Things to Ponder: Data != Truth
*“In order to consider these fundamentals in detail, however, we must start with an alternative assumption about information itself: that there is nothing natural about information. Information, no matter what it is called—data, knowledge, or fact, song, story, or metaphor—has always been designed.”*

—Brenda Dervin, *Chaos, Order, and Sense-Making*

## Scales of Measurement

All variables are either nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio as introduced in the 1940's by [Stanley Smith Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Smith_Stevens)

### Qualitative Data 

**Nominal Data: categories, data has no ordering or direction.**
A nominal scale describes a variable with categories that do not have a natural order or ranking. You can code nominal variables with numbers if you want, but the order is arbitrary and any calculations, such as computing a mean, median, or standard deviation, would be meaningless.

Examples: genotype, blood type, zip code, gender, race, eye color, political party

**Ordinal Data: ordered categories (ranking, orders or scalings)**

An ordinal scale is one where the order matters but not the difference between values.

Examples: socio economic status (“low income”,”middle income”,”high income”), education level (“high school”,”BS”,”MS”,”PhD”), income level (“less than 50K”, “50K-100K”, “over 100K”), satisfaction rating (“extremely dislike”, “dislike”, “neutral”, “like”, “extremely like”).

Note the differences between adjacent categories do not necessarily have the same meaning. For example, the difference between the two income levels “less than 50K” and “50K-100K” does not have the same meaning as the difference between the two income levels “50K-100K” and “over 100K”.

### Quantitative Data

**Interval Data: Differences between measurements, but no true zero**
An interval scale is one where there is order and the difference between two values is meaningful.

Examples temperature (Farenheit), temperature (Celcius), pH, SAT score (200-800), credit score (300-850).

**Ratio Data: Differenes between measurements with true zero**
A ratio variable, has all the properties of an interval variable, and also has a clear definition of 0.0. When the variable equals 0.0, there is none of that variable.

Examples: enzyme activity, dose amount, reaction rate, flow rate, concentration, pulse, weight, length, temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really does mean “no heat”), survival time.

When working with ratio variables, but not interval variables, the ratio of two measurements has a meaningful interpretation. For example, because weight is a ratio variable, a weight of 4 grams is twice as heavy as a weight of 2 grams. However, a temperature of 10 degrees C should not be considered twice as hot as 5 degrees C. If it were, a conflict would be created because 10 degrees C is 50 degrees F and 5 degrees C is 41 degrees F. Clearly, 50 degrees is not twice 41 degrees.  Another example, a pH of 3 is not twice as acidic as a pH of 6, because pH is not a ratio variable.


### Linear vs. Logarithmic Scales

## Tools
[Python](https://www.python.org/)
[R](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/)
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
[P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
[MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

There are also software packages, like [Tableau](x), that are frequently used.

There are also good tools inside standard software, like Microsoft Excel.

## Different Kinds of data

But assuming you start a data visualization with data, look at the data. What do you have? What do you not have? Is there other data that might be interesting to combine? What story are you trying to tell about this data (in a completely ethical and objective way of course)?

Start sketching!

### Types of data:
Anything digital can be treated as data!
Sound
Pixel

Tables

[CSV: Comma Separated Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

[JSON: JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
Rainbow

Note: JSON is great, but the trick is getting used to "traversing," or getting the right syntax to get the data you want.

Not really a "type of data" but you will often get data through an [API: Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). Most API's deliver JSON formatted data.
